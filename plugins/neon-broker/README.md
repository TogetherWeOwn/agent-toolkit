# Neon metadata source slice

**Source-only; not an installable plugin, complete provider package or live grant.**
No manifest/worker/tool registration, default fetch, credential placement, SQL,
secret sink or enablement flag is supplied. GET and mocked success do not prove
non-waking behavior. NO MINT / NO BIND / NO ENABLEMENT remains the boundary.

## Typed adapters

`createNeonMetadataOperations(trustedScope, transport)` exposes exactly:

| Tool | Closed arguments | Authorization resource |
|---|---|---|
| `neon.getProject` | `project_id` | `neon/projects/<project>` |
| `neon.listProjectBranches` | `project_id` | `neon/projects/<project>/branches` |
| `neon.getProjectBranch` | `project_id`, `branch_id` | `neon/projects/<project>/branches/<branch>` |
| `neon.listProjectBranchEndpoints` | `project_id`, `branch_id` | `neon/projects/<project>/branches/<branch>/endpoints` |
| `neon.getProjectEndpoint` | `project_id`, `endpoint_id` | `neon/projects/<project>/branches/<bound-branch>/endpoints/<endpoint>` |

Trusted scope contains one project, a revision, explicit branch IDs and endpoint
parent bindings. Construction validates and copies it. Caller IDs only select
already-configured resources; no caller identity, authority, origin, credential,
cursor, generic action or approval claim is accepted. The common core—not these
adapters—authenticates runtime company/agent/project/task/run and enforces BOTH
agent and exact-resource policy before credential access and execution. Aggregate
collection targets require their own policy grant; a project or child grant does
not confer collection authority. The upstream project/branch list request is
therefore explicitly collection-scoped; child filtering is additional projection,
not a replacement for authorizing that upstream request.

Response IDs and project/branch/endpoint relationships are checked. Output contains
only project ID/region/Postgres major; branch ID/project/state/default/protected;
endpoint ID/project/branch/type/state/disabled. Names, hosts, owners, settings,
passwords, credentials and connection strings are excluded. Unknown lifecycle
states fail closed until explicitly supported. No error body/headers are surfaced.
Common lease-reflection checks remain necessary even in these selected fields.

`createNeonMetadataTransport(injectedFetch)` has five typed methods only. Its
internal request builder fixes origin `https://console.neon.tech`, `/api/v2`
paths, GET, JSON content, no redirects and no retries. No global fetch fallback
exists. Each response is bounded to 64 KiB and 1 s, including streamed body time;
each operation has a 3.5 s common-core deadline. Branch lists request 10 rows per
page, fixed name/ascending order and no deleted rows, for at most three pages.
Opaque cursors are bounded, encoded, never output/audited, and cycles refuse.
Over-limit/inconsistent pages refuse rather than return silent partial success.
Endpoint lists have no pagination in the pinned API and cap at 30 rows; unexpected
pagination refuses. No request wakes/starts/resumes/suspends/restarts compute or
fetches connection metadata/secrets as a fallback. This describes requests we
construct, **not provider non-wake evidence**.

## Shared contract and candidate compatibility

Contract: `toolkit.provider-broker/v1`. Upstream candidate: [PR #17](https://github.com/TogetherWeOwn/agent-toolkit/pull/17),
commit `3ce5639db8ebd7d1d2d77e69b28761bd044b6ca3`. The type-only excerpt in
`compat/provider-contracts.d.ts` is byte-compared declaration-by-declaration in
Actions against that exact source. It contains no common executor, policy,
authorization store, scheduler or runtime implementation. Once reviewed compatible
core is available, replace the excerpt with its type import before qualification.
No unreviewed candidate is linked into a live worker.

The ordinary Actions suite builds and runs mocked adapter/transport contracts.
The additional `Neon candidate contract (not live qualification)` job checks out
the immutable candidate separately, builds it in Actions, and runs `core.compat.mjs`
against its reusable `providerFixture`. This proves only compatibility with that
candidate and synthetic host/policy/journal/audit/credential adapters. It does
not establish durable/native grants, acceptance of core or safe live integration.
There is no test-time network fallback if the fixture is missing.

## Coverage and verification

`api-snapshot.json` preserves all 194 documentary operation rows, checked against
the official [v2 schema](https://neon.com/api_spec/release/v2.json), SHA-256
`bcc73bd5e55a57a5349791a6367e62b39763cc512e49346b27a4436bb79ebafa`.
`operation-map.json` uses the common v1 machine-readable format: five implemented
source adapters, 189 incomplete rows, unknown credential entitlement everywhere,
and `reviewed: false`, `enabled: false` throughout. Neither the five adapters nor
internal consistency validation makes the package complete. No SQL/data-plane
surface is implied by management-schema coverage.

GitHub Actions is CI of record. No local full suite, build/typecheck or CI mirror
was run. Exact-head run/job results belong in the PR verification packet; missing
or failed checks remain gates. Source model binding was observed as
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL=gpt-6.1-sol`; no substitution or model/pool change was made.

REA angle: reuse the official Neon API schema, existing closed-schema validators,
and the common ProviderOperation/fixture contract instead of inventing authority.
